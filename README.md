# NS_JS_Tip-Calculator_Project

Problem Statement: Whenever I go out to eat and I’m having a hard time calculating the 
right tip, I’ll fumble with my phone and search for a “tip calculator” on Google.

Considering problem faced and I have made Tip calculator website which will helps users to calculate tip person based on tip percent and show the total bill amount.
The website is designed in such a way that users won't face any UI issue - simple and easy to get the job done.
